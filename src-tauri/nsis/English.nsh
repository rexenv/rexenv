; rexenv's copy of Tauri's NSIS English strings (tauri.conf.json -> customLanguageFiles).
; THREE strings differ from Tauri's, all about the running-app check: that check matches
; rexenv.exe, and the DNS agent IS rexenv.exe (--dns-agent), so the stock 'rexenv is running!
; Click OK to kill it' fired for a user who had quit the app and named the wrong thing (VM run
; 2, 19 Sep 2026). Every other string is Tauri's verbatim; a Tauri upgrade that adds one fails
; the build with an undefined LangString, which is the loud way to learn about it.
; NO BOM, deliberately: Tauri prepends its own when it copies this file into the NSIS tree,
; and a file that brought one too gave makensis two, which it rejects on line 1 (measured
; 21 Sep 2026). The file is ASCII, so it needs no BOM of its own.
